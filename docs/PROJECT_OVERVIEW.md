This document provides a comprehensive overview of the FastAPI RealWorld Demo project architecture, technology choices, and design principles.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The FastAPI RealWorld Demo is a **development-focused reference implementation** that demonstrates:

- **Modern FastAPI Development**: Latest patterns and best practices

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The FastAPI RealWorld Demo follows a clean, layered architecture based on Domain-Driven Design principles:

### System Context
![System Context Diagram](../diagrams/architecture/c4-context.svg)

The system serves multiple client applications (web, mobile, desktop) through a unified REST API, with external monitoring and analytics integrations.

### High-Level Architecture
![Container Diagram](../diagrams/architecture/c4-container.svg)

The application consists of two main containers:
- **FastAPI Web Application**: The core application built with Python 3.12 and FastAPI
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Persistent data storage with full ACID compliance

### Internal Component Structure
![Component Diagram](../diagrams/architecture/c4-component.svg)

The FastAPI application is organized into distinct layers:
- **API Layer**: HTTP endpoints and request/response handling
- **Service Layer**: Business use cases and transaction orchestration
- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and entities
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Data access and external system integration
- **Shared Components**: Cross-cutting concerns (events, JWT, transactions)

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

## 🎛️ Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Purpose | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **API** | HTTP interface | Request validation, response formatting, authentication |
| **Service** | Use cases & orchestration | Business workflows, transaction management, event publishing |
| **Domain** | Business logic | Entities, business rules, domain events, domain services |
| **Infrastructure** | External concerns | Database repositories, ORM mappings, external APIs |

## 🔑 Design Principles

### Clean Architecture
- **Dependency Inversion**: Core business logic doesn't depend on infrastructure
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Interface Segregation**: Well-defined contracts between layers
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Extensible without modifying existing code

### Event-Driven Design
- **Loose Coupling**: Domains communicate through events, not direct calls
- **Audit Trail**: All business changes generate trackable events
- **Extensibility**: New features can listen to existing events
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking operations for better performance

### Type Safety & Quality
- **Full Type Annotations**: MyPy validation at compile time
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E test coverage
- **Documentation as Code**: Docstrings and architectural decision records
- **Automated Quality Checks**: Linting, formatting, and type checking in CI/CD
